= New Features

* A view_subdir_leading_slash plugin has been added, for using the
  current view subdirectory for all templates that do not start with
  a slash.  The default behavior when using view subdirectories
  remains to use the current view subdirectory unless the template
  name includes a slash.  This makes it easier to use nested view
  subdirectories, at the expense of making it slightly more difficult
  to use templates outside the current view subdirectory.

= Other Improvements

* The render_each and each_part plugin template selection code is
  now more optimized when the application is frozen and using the
  :assume_fixed_locals render plugin option.

* The render_each and each_part plugin default local generation
  is now more optimized on Ruby 3+.
