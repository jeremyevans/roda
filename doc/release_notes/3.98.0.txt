= New Features

* The sessions plugin now supports an :env_key option, which allows
  the use of a non-default env key. This allows you to maintain the
  session for the Roda application separately from the default Rack
  session.  This can be useful in all of the following cases when you
  want to have the Roda application use a separate session from other
  applications or middleware:

  * Using middleware in the Roda application.

  * Using the Roda application as middleware in another Rack
    application.

  * Using r.run in the Roda application to call another Rack
    application.

  * Calling the Roda application from another Rack application using
    the same env hash.
