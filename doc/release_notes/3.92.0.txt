= New Features

* An each_part plugin has been added, offering a simpler method for
  using render_each with locals:

    # With render_each:
    render_each(array_of_foos, :foo, locals: {bar: 1})

    # With each_part:
    each_part(array_of_foos, :foo, bar: 1)

  The each_part provides similar benefits to the render_each plugin
  that the part plugin provides to the render plugin.  The each_part
  method has been optimized to work with the render plugin's
  :assume_fixed_locals option.
